# Travel Per Diem Tracker
Excel sheet that helps automate tracking of expenses when on work travel

### Before travel
User needs to fill in:
* per diem costs, broken down by category (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, M&IE), and 
* first and last days of travel.

### During travel
* Expenses need to be entered per line in the table.

### What it does
* Table will lookup values based on expense description and associate correct meal.
* First and last days of travel are adjusted to 75% of costs, following rules by GSA.
* Total and per-expense differences are calculated, allowing user to see if adjustments need to be made
* Per card expenses can also be tracked if wanted, in order to know where to distribute funds once expense reimbursement has been processed.
